<p>
The devotion of all nations, in all ages of the world, to tutelar 
divinities and patron saints, is a remarkable characteristic of the 
intuition of religious inspiration. The prosperity and destiny of 
communities and empires were, at an early period of history, thought 
to depend upon their guardianship and presence. Not only has 
mankind been deified, and exalted to superior excellence, and even 
veneration, but most every creature of the animal kingdom has also 
been enshrined in heathen sanctity. The sole difference in the 
degree of their exaltation, appears to have been in the greater 
universality, the greater nationality, of the worship and reverence 
paid to the higher and nobler attributes of god-like man. The 
religious regard for the lower animals was local, and less intense. 
Feelings of sacred respect, rather than sentiments of divine worship, 
were called up at the shrine of these inferior deities. Cities and 
towns were guarded and protected by beasts and birds; worlds and 
empires by men alone. In a primitive age, the untutored mind and 
unsophisticated reason, lost in the sublimity of primordial poetry, 
and bewildred by the mysticism of tradition, always tended to lend 
a fabulous and superstitious character to objects of their admiration, 
wonder or worship. 
</p><p>
Birds had no small claim upon their affections, and were more 
particularly of the secondary class of divinities. Though the Phoenix 
of the Egyptians—the Roc of the Arabian romancers—and the Eagle 
of the Romans, far from being local, were renowned and revered 
throughout the known world. All of these objects of worship, human 
or brute, universal or local, had an intimate connection with the 
hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows, the religion and poetry of 
every nation of antiquity. The mystic power of religious superstition, 
mingled with the rich imagery of Oriental poetry, has lent a charm 
to these creatures of the imagination, that even the illumined intellectuality and the prosaical gravity of modern times has failed to 
eradicate. Whatever is noble and good in them warms the heart, 
whatever is rich and gorgeous dazzles the mind, and whatever is 
grand and terrific awes the soul, no less in an age of truth and reason 
than in an age of fable and fiction. Nor were nations and cities 
alone objects of care and solicitude; but villages, hamlets, and cottages 
were sheltered under the spread wings of the tutelar bird. Every 
grove and every wood, every nook and every home became an object 
of regard, as it became the haunt and retreat of the favorite deity. 
These mythic influences have not yet died away. They still dwell 
among us, mellowing our pleasures and lightening our sorrows, like 
the twilight of the dark past, lingering on the horizon of the glorious 
present. But the power with which these fantasies still enchain us 
is not so much due to our superstition, as to our love for the marvellous 
and our reverence for the past. 
</p><p>
The above exordium to our history of this notable bird may be 
thought by most of our readers to be out of place. They may be 
surprised that a character so well known, should be spoken of in connection with what is unreal and fabulous. They may also think that 
we are transcending our rights and duties as legitimate Ornithologists 
in devoting our labor, and wearying their patience, in a long investigation and description of an inanity. As we propose, however, to 
enter upon a philosophical inquiry into the origin and history of this 
bird, we hope no apology is necessary, believing our motives discoverable from what we shall say regarding it.
</p><p>
The “Florence Humming Bird,” is by many supposed to be the 
trusty custodian of our pleasures. Very true, it dwells among us, an 
object of esteem and love. Very true it is, too, that none of its 
actions are associated with majesty or sublimity, nor with war or pestilence. Yet it <em>is</em> with peace and contentment, charity and justice, 
and all the moral excellencies of an age of progress and refinement. 
It does not defy the voracity of the devouring flames, and miraculously resucitate. Neither does it perch aloft on the battle-standard 
midst blood and carnage, but sits gently on the humble “olive 
branch of peace.”
</p><p>
The spirit of the world, and incentives to human actions, are 
changing. Ambition seeks not eminence in tyranny and conquest, 
but in the quiet walks of mercy and benevolence. Fancy, too, is 
changing. It no longer broods over darkness, creates 
<span class="inline-blockquote">
“Hydras, gorgons, and chimeras dire,”
</span>
and mystifies the better sense of the human family. With the same 
poetry, and the same noble aim, it pleases and frightens, by the 
sweetness or terror of its creations, measured by the sense, and 
adapted to the intelligence of the age. So it is with the pleasing 
phantasms of our bird’s eventful story. Quiet pleasure, like the 
incubation of the halcyon, attends its welcome visits, and simple 
retreats. Moral effects result from moral causes. Reason and imagination have emerged from a halo of heathen glory, and dwell on the 
altar of Christian morality.
</p><p>
The few ephemeral antiquarians and wiseacres of the present day 
have twisted and corkscrewed from their minds singular notions and 
vagaries in regard to the origin and pedigree of this bird. Ever bound 
and ever ready to combat their erroneous opinions, we enter upon 
the task with no ordinary feelings of gratification. In the midst of 
his socialistic enjoyment, and his unbounded popularity, our bird has 
become so effectually incorporated with the minds and actions of our 
citizens, that he has quite lost his individuality. We do not wonder, 
then, that so little is known of his personal history, and that there is 
no inquisitive desire among the mass of the community to know 
it more particularly. Nor do we wonder that there are those, 
whose affection for antiquity, so far exceeds their love of utility, 
as to lead their philosophic minds to an investigation of obsolete and 
antiquated objects, invaluable in themselves. The great discoverer 
of the System of Tittlebats could not have displayed more assiduity 
and profound inquiry. As is generally the case, the fruit of their 
immense labor and application, has proved to be a net-work of fiction. 
We shall occupy the attention of our readers by presenting them with 
some of their surmises, and by showing their futility. They would 
wrap this bird in mystery, were it not ever present and appreciable. 
Even now they proclaim it an anomaly in Ornithological annals. 
Pretending to know what is above their comprehension, each grasps 
at a favorable illusion, and clings to it with a tenacity worthier of a 
better cause. Each having had his own favorite theory will adopt 
none other. They could never agree, nor never will. They have 
quarrelled and wrangled about the time of its creation. Is it antediluvian or post-diluvian? Is it of remote or recent existence? Of 
course, they all agree as to its antiquity, and produce innumerable 
proofs to establish their position. 
</p><p>
The great Slocum Buffum, the inventor of the beautiful theory 
of the Hystrykes, verifies, fortifies, and corroborates his hypothesis, 
by a resort to his deep and profound knowledge of the classic writers. 
He believes Horace to have been inspired with a spirit of prophecy,
when he wrote that far-famed passage,—“Rara avis, in terris incognita.” From the peculiarity of the Humming Bird to the American 
forest, and from the fact of America being an unknown and undiscovered country, he argues that the existence of this rare bird, with 
its rare merits and qualities, was predicted by that rare genius and 
poet. Others again in their pride of intellect have advanced plausible 
theories, placing this bird in a similar category with the Phoenix. 
Like that fabulous bird, it is single and bachelor. It appears never to 
have had a mate, but, existing solitarily and alone, then, now, and 
hence enjoying an immortality of life and fame. Though not an 
object of worship or reverence, they maintain that the influence of 
Christianity, and moral and mental refinement of the times, have 
only prevented it. They argue that the love and respect for it is but 
another form of worship suitable to the spirit of the age. 
</p><p>
Another remarkable circumstance confirmatory of their theory is 
its constant habit of hovering around “fires,” and its devotion to the 
extinguishers of the devouring element. And then, its habits of 
perseverance, of energy, and great pertinacity of resolution, rising 
always “Phoenix-like from its ashes,” please their vanity and flatter 
their pride. Now, however plausible their positions may be, they are 
neither solid nor true. We happen to know a little about this bird, 
through long observation and acquaintance. We have no speculative 
hypothesis, by which to torment our readers. We also happen to 
remember that every one, Naturalist or Antiquarian, or neither, can 
familiarize himself with its biography by a little observation. We 
can see none of those mysteries that have lost those subtle geniuses 
in a labyrinth of moon-struck speculations, and decoyed them into a 
snare of fine-spun metaphysics. Who, among us, except these pseudophilosophers, will not tell you that this bird, apparently peculiar 
and isolated, is but a species of the great genus “Omitho Vox-populi,” 
which that eminent and eloquent Ornithologist, Naturalist, and 
Cosmogonist, the great Estaphanus, has so exquisitely drawn, and so 
lucidly described to the astonished and astonishing multitude. Who 
is there that does not ridicule these notions? And who is there that 
wouldn’t? Indeed, so intimately is it associated with all of us, that 
to give the minutiæ of detail, the how, the why, and the wherefore 
of this bird, would neither enlighten the reader, or repay the writer 
for the trouble. As to the possibility or even probability of confuting 
or convincing those black-letter, ornithological heretics, it were as 
easy as to convert a millstone into a miller. Not desiring to satisfy 
them, and our readers having no occasion to be satisfied, we will let 
the object of our history speak for itself as it has always spoken. We 
shall rest content with having been the exponent of popular opinion, 
so strong a refutation of those erratic and heretic investigators. 
</p><p>
The habits of this bird are equally well-known with its history. 
They are, at once, uniform and multiform. It has been found in 
business habits, military habits, masonic habits, and divers other 
habits. <span class="racist">What may seem a paradox, it has been seen in black habits, 
though its character is good; for no one has yet questioned its gentlemanly bearing, and high-toned morality.</span> Its habits are neither 
regular or irregular. In fact, like the bird itself, they are peculiarly 
“Florence.” They are of the ordinary style with him, and of the 
extraordinary with others. 
</p><p>
Its disposition is of the best kind. It is cheerful, vivacious, gay, 
sociable, and benevolent. The “sweet little courtesies of life” are 
personified in its nature. Wherever it may be perched, or wherever 
it may fly, that Platonic smile, and that familiar nod, tells of its 
presence. It has been universally remarked, even by the least 
inquisitive observers, that this bird’s favorite delicacy is a “bough.” 
The lovers of rural enjoyment, too, have often, with emotions of 
rustic delight, watched, by the hour, this little bird flitting jocundly 
and happily, humming an amorous strain, from flower to flower, in 
the exuberant “Chesterfields,” now burying deep its bill in the heart 
of the “polite pink,” and now concealed within the bosom of the 
"chaste lily." 
</p><p>
Another delectably fond retreat of this bird is the “stump.” Who 
has not experienced lively feelings of pleasure, commingled with sadness, at the sight and continued observation of the truncated vestige 
of some lofty tree, proud, perhaps, in its day, but now sunk in deep 
humiliation? Have you never heard the sad and anon cheerful 
notes of some little bird on the remains of a decayed oak, mourning 
the loss of departed worth, and consoling and cherishing the tender 
shoots in their infancy and orphanage? Who knows? It may have 
been our pretty little “sympathy,” a fit synonym for such a bird. 
Its compassion is with the living and the dead. Its pity is with the 
conqueror and the conquered. The stump of all other stumps for it 
is the “hickory stump,” a curious inoculation of the cypress and the 
laurel. It often sings there the Pæans of victory; and if it mourns 
defeat, still it rejoices at the promising hopes of the future. Many a 
pleasant moment have we experienced in watching, with eager and 
glistening eye, its innocent love-pranks, while perched high on the 
myrtle bough, wooing with its sweet hum the “gay, sparkling loories,” 
votaries of Venus, borne to her arboriferous shrine on the bosom of 
gentle zephyrs. Often have we laid our hand gently upon our throbbing heart, and with uplifted eyes to the blue empyrean, unconsciously 
exclaimed, in the gentleness of our spirit, “What a sweet little fellow, 
it is, indeed!”
</p><p>
Its nest, like every thing connected with it, is peculiar, and a little 
curious. We have seen the hanging nests of the “Oriole,” and have 
thought them very odd. But the ingenuity of our bird exceeds in 
novelty and taste all other manifestations of inventive genius ever 
on record.
</p><p>
What is peculiar to the “humming bird” is its disposition of its 
home, and the strange tendencies of his highly developed organ of 
inhabitiveness. Unlike other ornithological specimens, it never 
sleeps at home, that is in its nest; but if it goes out to enjoy the 
warmth of the sun and the freshness of the fields, it always takes its 
nest along. The configuration and texture of which, is “wery 
pecooliar.” It is of a hat-like shape, and made of the finest silk. 
Nothing can be more humorous and mirth-provoking than to see 
this sweet bird, gamboling with its wonted hilarity, and bearing 
aloft, crest-like, on its organ of individuality, its symetrically beautiful residence, so serenely and fraternally supported by its long, elegant, 
and endearing bill, So remarkably popular has this hat-like home 
become, from its exquisite jauntiness, and winningly polished gracefulness, that the whole community at large, with accord and concord, 
have bestowed upon it the euphonious and altisonant cognomen of 
the “Florence Hat.” But this is not all. Our warm-hearted and 
admiring citizens are not satisfied with empty laudations. To show 
their high appreciation of its character, merits, peculiarities, and 
eccentricities, they have with great unanimity adopted a practice of 
wearing Florence hats on their heads, too. 
</p><p>
This circumstance is an eureka to an idiomatic enigma that has disgusted the uninitiated foreigner with the supposed excessive simplicity 
of our language. We ourselves have often wondered why it was, and 
why it is, that in the placidity of good spirits and moderate mirth, 
while taking a connoisseur-glance at the sports and deviltries of some 
merry wight, we should, with incontinent rapture, exclaim: “He’s a 
a bird, he is!” thus tending ultimately to convey our unmistakable 
impression of that individual being one of the ornithological tribe. 
</p><p>
Another peculiarity of this bird is worthy of a passing notice. It 
is a well ascertained fact, that all animals of the canine, feline, lupine, 
and porcine subdivisions of natural history, have hairy, whisker-like 
appendages, adorning their nasal protuberances, tending, in a greater 
or less degree, much to their ferocious appearance. We have seldom 
seen birds with these ornaments, except, perhaps, a little top-knot, 
adding much to their coxcombical attire. Our bird has been excepted 
from the general rule. It sports, with cavalier dignity, a luxurious 
exuberance of hirsute functionaries. We are as proud of them as it 
is, or as you are, dear reader. 
</p><p>
It is neither dormant nor migratory. It has, indeed, acquired a 
“local name and habitation.” It never hibernates, but dwells among 
us through summer and winter. However, there appear to have been 
of late, strong indications of a restless spirit, tending from its symptoms to emigration. For these last six annual cycles, it has made 
divers flutterings and flappings of its wings, and fruitless attempts to 
fly, but until now, in vain. Gifted with a vast deal of perseverance, 
it has at last, conquered its inability. It will remain with us during 
this summer; but during next December and the winter months 
following, it will hibernate on the Banks of the Potomac, and 
delight the neighborhood with its melodious hum. Unlike migratory birds, it does not leave us for its own good; but for our good. 
It goes away to hum the music of peace, and sing the lullaby of 
agitation in the great choral grove of the nation. 
</p><p>
It has been said, “Birds of a feather flock together.” This bird 
having no “fellow of a feather,” is never isolated from company, but 
is peculiarly sociable, and is ever welcome in all social circles. 
“Alone, but never lonely,” is the burden of its remarkable hum. 
</p><p>
Though we have spoken of its song, our bird is not one of those 
<span class="inline-blockquote">
“Little birds <br />
That warble on the flowery thorn.”
</span>
Perhaps, then, we have gone too far, for it has no voice, but a kind 
of a hum, produced by his rapid motions, yet attuned to music by the 
graceful curvatures of its perigrinatory movements. The hum very 
nearly resembles the “hum of industry,” of which we have heard so 
much. 
</p><p>
As a whole we admire this bird, as does every one. We love to 
see it flitting about, like a moth in a sunbeam, now here, now there, 
upon gossamer wings, dallying with the coquettish honey-suckle; 
anon, poised lightly and buoyantly upon the balmy air, and then, 
with lightning speed, dart out of sight, into the warm embraces of 
the inviting violet. 
</p><p>
How long this bird will live, what will become of it when it dies, 
we will not pretend to say. Our hopes are, that if it do not inherit 
immortality, that its shadow at least may never grow less. It is yet 
in the inception of its fame and name. Its embryonic name will, in 
time, mature to a greater and riper prestige. Under its soft and 
downy pinions, while skimming on the buxom air, are reposed 
“love, honor, obedience, and troops of friends,” circling around it 
in the expected hey-day of its triumphs and glories.
