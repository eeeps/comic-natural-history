<p>
Said the quaint old Bishop Fuller, " I have read of a bird which 
hath a face like, and yet will prey upon a man : who, coming to the 
water to drink, and finding there by reflection, that he had killed 
one like himself, pineth away by degrees, and never afterwards 
enjoyeth itself." How inapplicable to the creature of the present 
day, who, preying upon his fellow-man, reaps not only enjoyment, 
but profit, and perhaps a renown — of infamy. ' . 
</p>
<p>
Bom in a fable — a myth of the sunny climes of India, — it is yet in 
civilized Europe and America, a fact as palpable as the instability of 
a politician, or the falsity of friendship. It grows by what it feeds 
on, thriving most luxuriantly on the most dainty delicates of society 
— the pure and noble-minded heart ; the reputation, that, knowing 
no wrong, fears no stain, and recks not of the secret foe, until the 
Parthian shaft strikes home. 
</p>
<p>
There is a social, as well as a political Vampyre ; the former is 
more secret in its operations — ^it hails you with the kiss of peace — 
even with the taint of the thirty pieces of silver upon its lips, and 
giving you the embrace of friendship, daily inflicts the secret stab 
upon your honor and your reputation, tainting the life's blood, and 
withering the heart of the unconscious victim. The grasp of Caesar 
Borgia was not more sure; the poison which his envenomed ring 
gave forth was not more deadly, than is the tongue of the social Vam- 
pyre of the civilized world. 
</p>
<p>
Yea, we have known it to invade the Sanctuary ; to take the 
shape even of those who turn up their hypocritical eyes to heaven, 
and daily smiting their breasts, thank God they " are not as the pub- 
lican." 
</p>
<p>
Filled with a fervor, which in their blasphemous idea is akin to 
the Godhead, they ofier up solemn prayers with the lips, while in 
their hearts they are devising some smooth and specious tale of vil- 
lainy, which, in the eye of the truly righteous, would be deemed a foul 
lie, but which the sensitive minions of society soften into the inofien- 
sive term of " a little scandal." Mark then how eagerly, ere the 
dying tones of the last prayer have ceased to fall upon the ear, they 
seize some spirit like unto themselves, and into their ear *' pour the 
leprous distilment," the slander and the shame destined to murder 
some inoffending one by inches; with a refinement of torture draw- 
ing drop by drop the heart's blood of the guileless and the innocent 
being, whose crime it is to be purer than themselves. 
</p>
<p>
It has not the boldness and courage of the desperado, who meets 
you with the knife and the pistol, and at least gives you a chance for 
life in the deadly struggle. It lurks in the darkness ; it strikes in 
whispers ; it sends forth its venom in anonymous letters ; it fattens 
and revels on the good and noble heart in silence. Then, when 
bleeding at every pore from the foul slanders that meet it at every 
turning in the social world, the victim seeks for pity, and finds 
none : then comes the holiday of this fiend of hell, clothed in the 
garb of angels ! Then is this Yampyre of the human heart happy 
in the paradise it has created for itself, amid the ruined temples of 
humanity. 
</p>
<p>
The best specimens of a political Vampyre, are generally to be 
found at the head of some ostensible moral, and high-toned journal. 
All is fish that comes to their net; under the assumption of a political 
morality, they can indulge in the censure, the sneer and the lie ; true 
it is, avowing great candor, and " feeling the necessity of speaking 
boldly the truth," they sometimes "o'erstep the modesty of nature;'' 
and finding that the pulse of the community does not beat responsive 
to their own, cheerfully (as they say) make the correction, and are 
extremely gratified to be enabled so to do. But, "swifter than arrow 
from Tartar's bow," the poisoned shaft has fled with electric speed, 
throughout the length and breadth of the land ; and the correction, 
if made, may seek to overtake the lie, and seek in vain. It is 
Godwin, who says, we believe, in his novel of Mandeville, " They 
disseminate the lie, and send after it the acknowledgment of their 
error : but the lie flies fast, and the vindication never can overtake 
it." 
</p>
<p>
Now, your mere politician, is perhaps no better than he should be, 
and such is the opinion of the mass of the community. Your legis- 
lator and your statesman may occasionally expose their weakest spot ; 
the vulnerable part of Achilles was the heel, and the shaft of Paris 
found it ; so be assured, if the seeker after fame and power, however 
pure he may be now, has ever faltered, or fallen into a venial sin, 
the shaft of the political Yampyre will be sure to reach it, even 
through the dim distance of a score of years. As to the Yampyre 
himself, he is invulnerable to aught but " Black mail," judiciously 
administered. If there is a vulnerable spot about him, you may rest 
assured it is not the heart. 
</p>
<p>
Again, let the artist, filled with a high and noble appreciation of the 
beauty of her art, appear among us from a distant land; in her moral 
worth, sublime; in her artistical excellence, rare; a very woman, 
yet a true and honest one. You may hear afar, the flutter of the 
Vampyre's wings, as he circles round her, glaring upon her with a 
sinister eye. " The pound of flesh, but not one drop of blood," said 
Portia to the Jew. " The pound of flesh, aye, and the drop of blood," 
says your moral journalist, " or we will fasten on you, and day by 
day draw from your sensitive heart, by slander and defamation, by 
ridicule and bravado, the daily pang to darken your pathway through 
the world forever." K she resists, though she may sufier, good men 
will applaud ; if she succumbs, and feeds the ponderous maw of tlie 
vile thing, through fear, she will find as others have found, that the 
praise of the corrupt is more to be dreaded than their censure ; and 
that the surest way to meet and overcome such a foe, is to spurn with 
contempt the snake, whose touch is loathsome, and whose daily path 
is known by the slimy track he leaves behind. 
</p>
<p>
Yea, the Yampyre revels everywhere : in the Sanctuary, in the 
crowded mart, by the domestic hearth ; everywhere he is to be found. 
Strip off" the mask of hypocrisy which he wears abroad, and you will 
find the face of a fiend; beware, lest in doing so, you strike at the 
foundation of your worldly happiness, in thus betraying to your eyes 
the false face and false heart which you have daily taught yourself to 
love ; better, perhaps, to live on in ignorance of the wrong and deceit 
practised upon you, than to have your faith and hope in human love 
shattered forever. .
