When the artist presented for our inspection, the drawing of the 
Masonic Terrapin, we were sorely oppressed with " a confluence of 
ideas on the brain." It was almost an ideal-apoplexy : not however 
of that sort which is produced by eating terrapins. We lost all 
consciousness. Phantoms of Morganised turtles — Masonic suppers — 
free blows — champagne and cigars — songs and stories : — wit and 
whiskey — wine and watchmen — dyspepsia and diarrhoeticks passed 
before our vision, with funereal slowness and solemnity. It was long 
before we returned to a sense of actual vitality. Gazing on the 
picture, dreaming of the vision, the first impression that took the form 
of thought was to audibly inquire, if all these things belonged to the 
^* Family Robinson" — an indignant No from our publisher, startled us 
into our propriety. Then it was we discovered the great resemblance 
between a free mason and a free terrapin. It is in their shut-up-iveness. Ask a Mason his secret, touch him with an interrogatory, 
and he shuts-up, mum as a mummy. Touch a free terrapin as he is 
going quietly into his lodge on the sea-shore, to ask him when he 
will be ready for supper — and he shuts-up just like the Mason. The 
ancient York Mason, and the York cove oyster, and the York bay 
terrapin, must have some astounding secrets among themselves; 
when any do come out, won't the people gulp them down, secrets and 
shell-fish — ^which will go down the best, depends very much on how 
they are " cooked up." A secret on a chafing-dish, is a novelty — 
although the Masons do talk a great deal about their secrets on the 
"gridiron." It is about as easy for one to be "done brown," on 
either utensil. 
</p>
<p>
There is a marked resemblance between the turtle and the Mason : 
as we have shown — ^but we think the verisimilitude is liable to be 
yet further extended. There are as we know, mock turtles, snapping 
turtles, green turtles, and land turtles : so with the Masons — but the 
green Masons predominate over the snappers, and the mock Masons 
are scarce. The only aqueous specimen we ever heard of, was the 
one that mysteriously found its way into Niagara : this must have 
been a female specimen — of rather doubtful reputation — we never 
knew her consort, and she had a large family. Out of respect to 
so delicate a relation in life, her offspring always called her aunty- 
Mason. 
</p>
<p>
We have thrown, all the 4ight of Masonry,' or rather terrapinic 
Masonry, in our power ; if more is desired by the reader, we refer him 
to R. "W. P. G. M. Chandler, who any night in the wick, will light up, 
show the moulds and the dips of ancient Greece, and then sit down 
over a Masonic terrapin, and other fixings, with a degree of satisfaction 
only known to the mysteries of the Order. There is something 
very fat, jovial, good-natured, and convivial in a terrapin. Who has 
not decided a bet over terrapin for 6? — who has not been of the 
party, feasted on terrapins and champagne ? — who has not been invited 
to join the social ^circle' in a 'box,' over terrapin and punch, where 
the night has glided away, till the small hours of the morning have 
crawled on the board ? 
</p>
<p>
Poor, defenceless, uncomplaining, heart-broken, secret- keeping 
terrapin. Food for publishers, painters, parsons, parasites, publicans, 
patriots, politicians, poets. Let us for a moment imagine three or 
four quiet, solemn, hungry parsons, after long fasting, with good 
digestion and a " special collection," orderly assembled, on a bleak, 
dreary, windy, December night, over " terrapins for half a dozen," 
a " little good old spirits," and cigars for their several affections of the 
bronchial organs : a picture of self-denial, victorious over worldly 
lust! Oh, if McClees & Germon, celebrated in their art, would 
only use their renowned skill in daguerreotyping these "shepherds," 
over this repast ! Poor terrapin ! Unite as a subscriber to a dinner 
to a " distinguished statesman ;" take a seat at the table ; listen to 
the speech of the chairman ; the patriotic toasts ; the great speech 
of the Hon. Washington Jefferson Jackson Smallpotatoes ; and 
cast your eye on the poor terrapin — still it keeps its own secret : 
mason-like. It never lets out a word or sign of complaint or anguish. 
It serves as the basis of all the satisfaction of these gatherings. It 
performs an important part, in political or pious feasts. 
</p>
<p>
That the student may not be in doubt, we have drawn the likeness 
of one of these singular quadrupeds in full life. It " stands erect," 
full of fat and fun. In one eye you see the mischievous twinkle of 
a "Billy Vidkins," in the other, the quiet drollery of a "John 
Donkey" — a combination of character, which once germinated in 
the phiz of a * printer's devil,' but which is now subdued into that in- 
telligent serio-comic expression which so admirably belongs to ' our 
publisher.* Extraordinary terrapin! True to its character, it 
furnishes food for the fun-loving reader to-day ; to-morrow solemnizes 
itself into a condition to refresh the pious Christian who delights in 
religious literature ; the next day, cooked up into that flavor which 
gives a gout to a * Dutch almanac,' and ever and anon is hashed up 
into all kinds of ragouts, from a * paper book' to a ' pamphlet.' Good 
terrapin! Never complaining, always fat, ever jolly, universally 
secret, yet proffering 'proof upon proof of the characteristics we have 
delineated. 
</p>
<p>
The unlearned reader may inquire, if our specimen is a * heifer' or 
a ' cow,' as by these terms terrapins are known to the epicure. What 
a question to be suggested after all we have already said ! A cow ? 
Oh, Sam, who would have thought for a moment, you could 
be mistaken for any * udder' kind than you are ! You are no cow ; 
you worship at no such tit-ulary shrine. Benevolent as our artist has 
truthfully drawn you, you are the parent of no such common-veal, 
as, with the " lowing herd, winds slowly o'er the lea." Meek, gentle, 
and kind as you are, no cow-ard blood is to be found under your 
shell. No, poor terrapin, you are no cow, whatever else you may be. 
Judging from the eggs, which are regarded as so delicate a morceau 
in the cooked terrapin, one would fain believe you were a fowl — ^yet 
you are "no chicken" — ^however much you may, as our publisher, 
look after our brood, as the result of * Hen.'s' eggs. You may be a heifer. 
But after taking a look at the drawing, we opine, that he who would 
doubt as to your proper position in this or any other Natural History 
might expect at your hands, what in France is called, a " bull-verse-ment," such a shaking, as in all after time could leave no doubt on 
the subject. But so long as those ' re-gal-ia' are about, you will keep 
your secret on the subject ; and we wont further put you " to press," 
or have you bound *in calf,' to answer. You carry on your back a 
coat of ' mail,' at all events ; and if the public, in testimony of your 
efforts on our behalf, will only ' shell-out,' so that you may gain the 
' shell-ings,' and save yourself from being one of Pharoah's " lean 
kind," you can stand well the cream of this joke, and not be under 
the necessity of committing cannibal-istic suicide, in eating yourself. 
Poor terrapin ! well, you have been cooked up in a new dish this 
time. Some men say, " Save us from our friends !" but you can cry 
out ! " Save me from a cuisine !" [don't mistake the word for cousin] as 
thus being ' roasted' is worse than " a stew." Roasted terrapin is 
an Epicurean novelty. And you don't like it ? Well, we have full 
faith in your Masonic teachings, that you will keep this as a secret, 
and never let the world know the current of your thoughts on the 
subject. Fare-well, friend terrapin, and if in our remarks we have 
been the least personal — if we have trod on your toes — if we have 
hurt your feelings — if we have taken you by the " collar" — or pulled 
too hard at your " apron"-string — if we have put your temper to the 
" proof" — if we have said a a word, that, unlike yourself, could be , 
mistaken — we will go to Guy's, or Prosser's, or * Jenny's,' or some 
other place, and settle this difference, by showing the difference 
between a Masonic terrapin and a terrapinized Mason.

Well, reader, who ever you may be, we have endeavored to en- 
lighten, instruct, and amuse you, on the subject of a Masonic terrapin 
in particular, or, more properly speaking, a particular Masonic 
terrapin. Fully to understand all we wish the types to express, you 
must familiarize yourself with the process of practical printing. Go 
for example into a large and celebrated printing establishment — take 
King & Baird's — ask for the " head devil" of the concern, request him 
to inform you in what manner printing on tjrpes, or publishing, is con- 
nected with a Masonic terrapin. The question is worth the asking, for 
he will answer it promptly, by introducing to you the publisher of 
Stephens' Natural History; then, if you can properly realize the exact 
impression that ought at once to force itself on your mind, you will 
invite the editor, author, and publisher, and the printer that " set- 
up" this copy, to go round to " Rockwell's," and enjoy with you a good 
old-fashioned terrapin supper. Well, let's go. Just a snug party — 
Let's see : Editor 1, publisher 2, reader 3, author 4, printer 5 ; yes, 
that's right, come on ! Sam ! terrapins for
