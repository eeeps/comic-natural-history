One of the primary objects of the present book has been, and is, to 
correct the many errors of preceding writers in the department of 
science of which this our work treats; and to disabuse the public 
mind of the many false notions that have obtained by the too ready 
credence given to the statements of those authors whose works have 
so long been regarded as standard, and whose opinions so implicitly 
received, that many even now hold it heresy to doubt them. For 
the benefit of those who have been thus misled, we will first expose 
the misrepresentations of previous writers, and then give the results 
of our observations on the character and habits of the Picus. And 
although we draw but an individual of the genus, yet it is such a 
beautiful specimen on which to generalize, exhibiting in itself all the 
better characteristics of its tribe, that all may feel assured, ours is a 
faithful portrait. 
</p>

<p>
The celebrated wood engraver, author of the “History of British 
Birds, etc. etc.,” Thomas Bewick, whose opportunities for observing 
and acquiring a thorough knowledge of the character and habits of 
this interesting bird were so much greater than all preceding Ornithologists, that we might reasonably have expected from him the most 
complete history of it, yet so meagre and erroneous is his description, 
as to lead us to the conclusion that he intentionally cut it, (the bird, 
not the description) therefore he should not be quoted as authority 
at all. 
</p>
<p>
Buffon describes its length as “somewhat more than nine inches;” 
— “somewhat more,” we think also, as the individual we describe 
extends a fraction over that measurement, being exactly six feet. 
He further tells us that “the head is wholly crimson;” in the specimen whose portrait is given herewith, it is of a dark brown, and we 
are sorry to add, shows a seeming tendency towards premature baldness of the crown. 
</p>
<p>
Yarrell states that " this bird is one of the earliest to retire to 
rest, and reposes in its hole till day." The Picus Gihonis, however, 
is not of this habit, being seldom found in its nest, until after most 
other birds have “shaken up their straw;” nor have we ever known 
it to comply with that request so frequently made, “go in your hole.”
</p>
<p>
The Gihonis seldom associates with birds of its own species, except 
when engaged in the occupation by which its sustenance is procured, 
and from whence its name of Picus is derived ; but from among the 
feathered race, chooses for companions, birds seemingly of very different character from its own, — but who, in fact, possess qualities in 
sympathy with it; thus for instance, we frequently see our specimen 
of the Picus, in company with the Hen, hovering about the roost of 
the Canvas-Back Duck, and so great is the regard of the “Dux Pictor 
Woodsideii” for these companions, that when with them, it is seldom 
or never known to take to the water , or if it does, — there must, as the 
sagacious Sowers observes, “he something in it.”
</p><p>
We have now to speak of the principle characteristic of the Picus,
namely its habit of pecking wood. This operation it performs with 
the most remarkable dexterity, the perforations it makes being found 
to assume the most curious and beautiful forms; representing the 
various productions of nature and art, in such an accurate manner, 
that of late years the Doctors and scientific men generally, have been 
at much pains to procure the bits of wood that have passed under its 
bill, and have applied them to various purposes tending to the 
advancement of science and the spread of knowledge. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Blanchard & Lea, the celebrated Publishers of Philadelphia, 
have taken much interest in the productions of this bird, and are in 
possession of a very extensive collection of the wood-blocks wrought 
by our Picus, which though they value very highly, they generously 
offer from them to supply the public with impressions, to whatever 
extent they may be demanded. These gentlemen have frequently 
and minutely examined the hill of the Picus Gihonis, and assure us, 
that it is five per cent, less than has been represented. 
</p><p>
Yarrell informs us that it labors principally upon the elm and beech ; 
this we presume to be simply an error in orthography, and that heach 
was intended. As our Picus was known to pay a flying visit to, — 
and was frequently seen, hopping about Cape May during the present 
season ; and as to its " laboring principally upon the elm," as Yarrell 
states, we are satisfied that it has a decided preference for the box 
wood; this may however be considered its graver occupation, for 
when thus engaged it has a very sober air, although holding a glass 
continually under its bill; and when deprived of this its favorite 
employment, it will pick anything within reach ; though we would 
make exception in favor of pockets and quarrels. By the way, speaking of quarrels, perhaps some of our readers, (should we be lucky 
enough to have any) may feel disposed to quarrel with us for being 
so prolix. Therefore we at once cut the cutter.
