	<h1>The Lark</h1>
	<p class="latin-name">(Alauda noctivagans.)</p>
</div>

<p>
Well do we remember our boyhood's days, when the injunction 
that good boys should rise with the lark, if they wished to prosper in 
this world, was served up to us with our daily breakfast. But 
singular as it may appear, although we always retired well-filled 
with good resolutions, we invariably found our courage oozing out 
of our fingers ends, Bob-Acres like, in the morning. This, our 
readers may be assured, was a frequent source of grief to us in our 
days of jacketdom; but on arriving at maturer years, "getting no 
better very fast," we have been strengthened and encouraged in our 
daily backslidings by frequent recurrence to the well known anecdote 
of Chief Justice O'Grady and his hopeful son : 
</p>
<p>
" Get up Jack," said the Chief Justice, "the early bird catches the 
worm."
</p>
<p>
" Serves the worm right for getting up so early," replied young 
hopeful. 
</p>
<p>
" Ye wyche," saith the ancient chronicler Pepys, " was a pregnynte 
and ryghte wittie reply e." > 
</p>
<p>
As for the lark, which is no doubt the early t)ird referred to by the 
Chief Justice, we have caught several of them in our day, and have 
been on terms of intimacy with many in the merry season of youth ; 
we purpose showing in this paper the specimen we refer to, and 
which our readers will observe, resembles in many prominent points, 
the bird known by the name of the lark in the writings of the 
various ornithologists, though hitherto unknown to Wilson or 
Audubon. The fidelity of the likeness may be depended upon, as 
it was drawn on the spot by our artist from a rare specimen in the 
hands of a watchman " early in the morning." 
</p>
<p>
Wilson, speaking of the lark, observes : " In this genus of birds 
the bill is straight, slender, bending a little towards the end, and 
sharp-pointed." The bill of the man lark, on the contrary, is gen- 
erally large and of great length ; we have seen several, however, 
that looked as if they had been suddenly " cut short." There are 
several species of the lark, the man lark, however, combines the 
principal features of them all. .• 
</p>
<p>
" The sky-lark commences his song early in the Spring, and con- 
tinues it during the whole of the Summer, and is one of those few 
birds that chant whilst on the wing." 
</p>
<p>
As to the time of year in which the man-lark commences his 
song, it is immaterial to him; he knows no seasons, and chants 
indifferently well, either at night or in the morning early. 
</p>
<p>
" When the sky-lark first rises from the earth its notes are feeble 
and interrupted; as it ascends, however, they gradually swell to 
their full tone, and long after the bird has reached a height where it 
is lost to the eye, it still continues to charm the ear with its melody." 
</p>
<p>
The man-lark never touches the earth until he is overcome with 
the excess of his emotions, then his notes are feeble and interrupted. 
Before arriving at a horizontal position, he indulges in a series of melo- 
dious strains, not calculated to charm the ear, but on the contrar}'^, to 
disturb the peace of the Commonwealth, as well as the equanimity 
and temper of quiet citizens who wish to indulge in " a wink of the 
balmy" at midnight. 
</p>
<p>
" The sky-lark mounts almost perpendicularly, and by successive 
springs, and descends in an oblique direction, unless threatened with 
danger, when it drops like a stone." 
</p>
<p>
The man-lark rises perpendicularly, if he can, and also indulges in 
successive springs, until stopped by the summary proceedings of the 
night bird, whose duty it is " to watch and prey." He descends also 
very frequently in an oblique direction, but when threatened with 
danger, runs, if he is able — but after having been on " a flyer," finds 
it somewhat difficult. 
</p>
<p>
"The female forms her nest On the ground, generally between 
two clods of earth, and lines it with dry grass." 
</p>
<p>
The man-lark finds his nest ready made, and it is a matter of in- 
difierence to the " clod " whether he " rests his head upon a lap of 
earth," or indulges in a soft and balmy repose upon a cellar door. — 
Never having examined his nest, we cannot speak with certainty as 
to the lining, although we have often heard him told to "get out of 
that high grass !" It is to be presumed in this respect he agrees with 
the sky-lark. ' «* 
</p>
<p>
"In the Autumn, when these birds assemble in flocks they are 
taken in vast numbers." 
</p>
<p>
As to the points of resemblance with the man-lark, see 10 Swift's 
Rep. ; 1 Jones' Cond. Rep. ; 1 Gilpin's Dig, 
</p>
<p>
"The wood-lark is generally found near the borders of woods, 
perches on trees, and sings during the night, so as sometimes to be 
mistaken for the nightingale." 
</p>
<p>
The man-lark prefers cities, perches any where, sings at any time, 
and can always be distinguished from the nightingale. 
</p>
<p>
Eschewing brilliant and complicated airs, he indulges in simple 
and touching melodies, applicable both to time and place, such as, 
*' Landlord, fill the flowing bowl ;" " We won't go home till morning ;" 
and ending in a state of semi-consciousness while being escorted by a 
guard of honor to his night's repose, with " Carry me back." 
</p>
<p>
" The wood-lark is of a reddish drab color, with a whitish tint 
beneath ; a broad patch on the breast and under each eye, as well as 
the lateral tail feathers black." • ^ " . 
</p>
<p>
The face of the man-lark is of a similar color, inclining more to 
the reddish, a spot or patch on the pantaloons instead of the breast, 
and one or two under each eye, or sometimes only one. These 
features^ however, rarely appear until the close of the night, or on 
the following morning. The lateral tail feathers are of various hues, 
and generally draggled. 
</p>
<p>
"The brown-lark is found in open fields, cultivated grounds, &c., 
near the water, and feeds exclusively on insects." Not so with the 
man-lark, who is of city growth, and who is ever found nearer to 
brandy and water, which he assiduously mingles, and absorbs in the 
proportion of ten to one ; — "Very little water, if you please; hold up ! 
do you want to drown it?" The "it" of course referring to the 
brandy, and not to the insects in the water, against whom he wages 
a determined war; agreeing in that respect, with the celebrated 
Jonathan Sucker, [1 Finn's Com. Aim. H. Rep. 192,] of whom it was 
felicitously observed by C. J. Van Dunck, in the well known Zuyder- 
Zee case, " That of water alone he drinks no more than a rose sup- 
plies its own dew on a summer's morn." 
</p>
<p>
Of a bird so frequently met with, we feel it is unnecessary to say 
any thing more. For the information of those who have not 
< travelled" as extensively as a majority of the youth of this city, we 
beg leave to append the authorities from which we have derived our 
knowledge. — 1 Mino's Rep. Bender's edition, [Star page] 120. — Cob- 
ler V8. Smasher, 5 Guy's Dig. 156.— ^Nips m. Blizzard, 4 Pelletier Rep. 
200. — 15 Mooney, 225. [Every page of this work is replete with 
information, and may be studied with advantage by every student.] — 
Swift's Rep. 1 to 10.— 1 Gilpin's Rep. 65.-7 Parsons' Rep. C. Q. S. 
[A most excellent work.] 
</p>
<p>
In conclusion we would observe, we have retired from the Profes- 
sorship ! If, therefore, any aspiring youth wishes to know more of 
this subject, a careful study of the above authorities, will bring him 
in contact with many earnest and learned students, who will show 
him at any time, at a reasonable expense, how " to train up a child, 
and away he goes"
